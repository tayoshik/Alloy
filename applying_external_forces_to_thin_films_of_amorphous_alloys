By applying external forces to thin films of amorphous alloys and inducing microscopic plastic deformation, the formation of unknown metastable phases is expected. This new approach offers innovative possibilities for catalytic science. Below we summarize the key aspects related to its potential use as a catalyst.

1. new phase formation by plastic deformation:.
It has been reported that by applying strong plastic deformation (Severe Plastic Deformation, SPD), new metastable phases can be generated from existing phases. In this process, high strains create defects in the material that promote the formation of new crystalline phases; SPD allows mechanical energy to create defects in the crystal structure, which contribute to the formation of new phases. In particular, the formation of different phases has been observed with the use of techniques such as high-pressure torsion and ball milling.

2. enhancement of catalytic activity:.
The metastable phases formed are in a high energy state and are expected to have more active chemistry than normal crystal structures. This may improve their effectiveness as catalysts. Refined crystal grains can remain in a metastable state with higher energy than normal crystal structures. This high-energy state may serve as an active site for catalytic reactions, leading to increased reaction rates and the development of new reaction pathways.

3. promotion effect by electromagnetic field:.
The unique electromagnetic field formed by the catalyst plays a role in assisting the formation of intermediate compounds and the efficient formation of final products. In particular, elucidating the role of electromagnetic fields at catalyst surfaces and interfaces will lead to the development of more efficient catalysts. The electromagnetic field has the effect of locally strengthening the electric field through plasmon resonance and other means, which may affect the growth rate of particles and the preferential growth of certain crystal planes. The electric field can also distort the crystal lattice and produce defects, which can have a significant impact on catalytic reactions by acting as catalytically active sites.

4. formation of unknown chemicals:.
Microscopic plastic deformation increases the potential for the formation of unknown chemicals by creating new metastable phases that cannot be obtained by conventional chemical methods. Such novel substances are expected to have new applications as catalysts. In particular, it has been reported that during mechanical alloying, the components in the alloy are redistributed by plastic deformation to form different intermetallic compounds. This process can lead to significant changes in the thermodynamic properties of the material and may create new catalytic properties.

5. structural control and catalyst design:.
By controlling the direction and strength of the electric field, it may be possible to intentionally control the shape of the particles. For example, by synthesizing rod-shaped or star-shaped particles, it may be possible to design catalyst structures suitable for specific reactions. Electric fields may also improve catalytic performance by altering the surface state of the particles, changing the adsorption energy of surface-adsorbed species or making the surface state more active.



By applying external forces to induce microscopic plastic deformation, unknown metastable phases may be generated in thin films of amorphous alloys. This newly generated metastable phase may exhibit high catalytic activity and is expected to be used as a catalyst. In particular, the combination of electromagnetic field formation and plastic deformation may enable new reaction pathways and highly efficient catalytic processes that could not be realized by conventional catalyst design.

Future research topics include the following
1. detailed structural analysis of metastable phases and elucidation of formation mechanisms
2. quantitative evaluation of the catalytic effect of the interaction between electromagnetic field and plastic deformation
3. development of design methods for optimal metastable phase structures for specific chemical reactions
4. establishment of plastic deformation processes suitable for large-scale production

Addressing these issues will further clarify specific catalytic mechanisms and their range of applications, leading to the development of new high-performance catalysts. This research field is expected to develop further in the future as a fusion area of materials science and catalytic chemistry.
